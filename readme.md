# [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition][1]

My solutions to assignments in CS231n (2017 Spring). PyTorch is used for all the parts that require using symbol computing frameworks.

## Trouble shooting for setting up the environment.

1. Failed to install Pillow

> sudo apt-get install libjpeg8 libjpeg62-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev

2. Failed to install gnureadline

> sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
